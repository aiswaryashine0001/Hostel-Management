# Logout Error Fix - Summary
Date: October 22, 2025

## 🐛 Problem Identified:
The logout functionality had conflicting endpoints and inconsistent URL usage across templates.

### Issues Found:
1. **Conflicting Routes**: Both POST `/logout` in StudentController and GET `/logout` redirect in WebConfig
2. **Inconsistent URLs**: Some templates used `/logout`, others used `/api/logout`
3. **Method Mismatch**: Templates using GET requests to POST-only endpoints

## ✅ Solution Implemented:

### 1. Controller Changes (`StudentController.java`):
- ✅ **Added GET `/logout` endpoint** for direct navigation
- ✅ **Kept existing POST `/logout`** for API calls
- Both endpoints invalidate session and handle logout properly

### 2. Configuration Changes (`WebConfig.java`):
- ✅ **Removed conflicting view controller** mapping for `/logout`
- ✅ **Eliminated route conflicts** between controller and config

### 3. Template Updates:
- ✅ **Updated `dashboard.html`**: Changed `/api/logout` → `/logout`
- ✅ **Updated `admin_dashboard.html`**: Changed `/api/logout` → `/logout`  
- ✅ **Verified `preferences.html`**: Already using correct `/logout`
- ✅ **Standardized all logout links** to use `/logout`

## 🎯 Result:
- **GET /logout** - Works for direct navigation (template links)
- **POST /logout** - Works for API calls (returns JSON response)
- **All templates** now use consistent `/logout` URLs
- **Session invalidation** works properly for both methods
- **Redirect to home page** after logout

## 📋 Files Modified:
1. `StudentController.java` - Added GET logout endpoint
2. `WebConfig.java` - Removed conflicting view controller
3. `dashboard.html` - Fixed logout URLs
4. `admin_dashboard.html` - Fixed logout URLs

## ✅ Testing Ready:
The logout functionality is now fixed and ready for testing. Users can logout from:
- Navigation bar logout links
- Dashboard logout buttons
- Both student and admin interfaces

All logout actions will properly invalidate the session and redirect to the home page.
